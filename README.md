Immediate tasks:

UX/UI
- High priority
  * Add a size capture to record stool form (S/M/L)
  * Add a colour capture to record stool form (predefined colors, perhaps an "Other" leading to a color wheel)
  * Split date and time and make time an optional
  * Change the list record stools to show stool and non-stool days (more timeline/calendar)
- Low priority
  * CSS for hovers and selections
  * Layout colors (e.g. header)
  
Technical
* Add authentication
* Change Firestore DB rules to be more stringent
* Move Stool Classifications to GraphQL db?
